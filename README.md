# Pygame Examples

I always learn better from examples -- a long tutorial explaining the
background doesn't do it for me. To that end, here's a collection of
[PyGame](http://pygame.org) example games I've developed in the
process of learning PyGame.

Right now there's:

 - `snake.py`: a simple ~100-line version of Snake.
 - `lunarlander.py`: a slightly-more-complicated Lunar Lander game.

Happy coding!
